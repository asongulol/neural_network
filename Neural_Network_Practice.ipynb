    "According to the nunique method, none of the categorical variables have more than 10 unique values, which means we’re ready to encode. Previously, we have encoded a single variable at a time, but Scikit-learn is flexible enough to perform all of the one-hot encodings at the same time. The only difference from our single variable example is we need to pass our attrition_cat variable list. Again, add and run the following code to your notebook:"

To create an effective checkpoint callback using the ModelCheckpoint method, we need to provide the following parameters:\n",

In data science, trained models are published in scientific papers, deployed in software, open-sourced on GitHub, not to mention passed along to colleagues. In these cases, it is not practical to pass along only model weights, which can cause frustration and confusion. Instead, we can use the Keras Sequential model’s save method to export the entire model (weights, structure, and configuration settings) to an Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5 (Links to an external site.)) file.
