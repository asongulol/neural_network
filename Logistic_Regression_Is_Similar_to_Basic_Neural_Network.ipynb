Since there are only 786 data points across eight features, this dataset is well suited for a logistic regression model, but still large enough to build a neural network model. Now that we have our dataset loaded into Pandas, we need to prepare the data to train both models. With our logistic regression model, there is no preprocessing or scaling required for the data. However, our basic neural network needs the numerical variables standardized. Therefore, we’ll need to keep track of a scaled and unscaled training dataset such that both models have the correct input data in their preferred formats.

    "Beyond the performance of both models, there are a few other factors to consider when selecting a model for your data. First, neural networks are prone to overfitting and can be more difficult to train than a straightforward logistic regression model. Therefore, if you are trying to build a classifier with limited data points (typically fewer than a thousand data points), or if your dataset has only a few features, neural networks may be overcomplicated. Additionally, logistic regression models are easier to dissect and interpret than their neural network counterparts, which tends to put more traditional data scientists and non-data experts at ease. In contrast, neural networks (and especially deep neural networks) thrive in large datasets. Datasets with thousands of data points, or datasets with complex features, may overwhelm the logistic regression model, while a deep learning model can evaluate every interaction within and across neurons. Therefore, the decision between using a logistic regression model and basic neural network model is nuanced and, in most cases, a matter of preference for the data scientist.\n",
